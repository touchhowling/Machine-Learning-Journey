# Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains an implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python. The code demonstrates how to train a Simple Linear Regression model on a dataset and visualize the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3 or above)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/touchhowling/day-2-linear-regression.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd simple-linear-regression
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your dataset file (`Salary_Data.csv`) in the project directory.

2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python simple_linear_regression.py
   ```

3. The script will train the Simple Linear Regression model on the dataset and generate two plots:

   - Scatter plot of the training set results: `Salary vs Experience (Training set)`
   - Scatter plot of the test set results: `Salary vs Experience (Test set)`

   The plots will be displayed on your screen.
