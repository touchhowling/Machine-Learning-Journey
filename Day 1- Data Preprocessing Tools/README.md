# Data Preprocessing Tools

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the process of data preprocessing using various techniques. It prepares the data for further analysis and machine learning tasks. The script uses the pandas library to handle data frames and the scikit-learn library for data preprocessing.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip with the following command:

```shell
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script `data_preprocessing.py` to your local machine.

2. Place the `data.csv` file in the same directory as the script.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python data_preprocessing.py
```

5. The script will read the `data.csv` file and perform various data preprocessing steps.

6. The preprocessed data will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.

## Explanation

The script follows the following steps for data preprocessing:

1. Importing the required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, and pandas.

2. Importing the dataset: The script reads the `data.csv` file using the pandas `read_csv` function and separates the features (X) and the target variable (y).

3. Handling missing data: The script uses the `SimpleImputer` class from scikit-learn to fill in missing values in the dataset. It replaces missing values with the mean of the respective column.

4. Encoding categorical data: The script uses one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into binary vectors. It uses the `ColumnTransformer` and `OneHotEncoder` classes from scikit-learn for this purpose.

5. Encoding the dependent variable: The script uses label encoding to convert the categorical target variable into numerical values. It uses the `LabelEncoder` class from scikit-learn for this purpose.

6. Splitting the dataset: The script splits the preprocessed data into training and test sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.

7. Feature scaling: The script performs feature scaling on the numerical features using the `StandardScaler` class from scikit-learn. It standardizes the features to have zero mean and unit variance.
